# BFS-DFS
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\
Depth-first search (DFS) âˆ’ It is a tree traversal algorithm that traverses the structure to its deepest node.
